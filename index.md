### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was a favorite because it was the first program I wrote that
    was a very simple game. It was also the first program that made me think
    and gave me a good challenge as a beginner programmer. It was the first time
    using If and If Else statements in a more complex manner.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was another favorite because it heavily utilized taking in inputs
    from the user. It also involved a great deal of math that was used by taking
    the inputs and applying it to a formula. It was interesting to be able to do
    something with the information given by the user, and then give back a reply.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was my most favorite because I always wondered how animations were
    made in programming. This lab was the first time we made an animation, and it was
    cool to see it actually work. I also learned how to program using multiple files,
    and then open files through my code.
